echo "I am working on the following project:

$(cat README.md)

The backend pretty much works:

# kva/__init__.py
$(cat kva/__init__.py)

# kva/test_core.py
$(cat kva/test_core.py)

Currently, this is a prototype where the functionality works but performance is not at all optimized.
Can you analyze potential performance issues and brainstorm ways to mitigate them?"
